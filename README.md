For any curious reader,
 
   This is a joke for our Software Design class, we were trying to break as many good coding standards and best practices and compare our 
bad implementations to others in the class to see which one was worse. This idea was based on the book "Best Practices of Spell Design" 
which is a story about which practices to follow and which ones to stay away from. It also explains each practice and how these practices
can be harmful through the rules of a fantasy world with spells, witches, and potions. 

   Some practices that were broken:
   
   - Variable naming conventions (The most obvious one)
   - Indentation/white space/proper code formatting
   - Making attributes public
   - Using a bad design and making code reuse abundant with if statements instead of using a design pattern.
   

Thank you for your understanding,

Best regards,

Jibraan, Newcomb Maddux, and Hayata Suenaga
